# AI Crop Disease Detection

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed üéØ
**How might we help farmers in rural areas reduce costs and improve efficiency by identifying crop diseases and affected areas using drone technology and AI?**

Examples of key challenges addressed:
* Inefficient pesticide application
* How might we reduce the time and costs associated with manual farm inspections for disease detection and pesticides usage?
* How might we provide actionable insights for disease management and prevention in crops through automated technology?

## Project Description ü§Ø
This project aims to assist farmers by using drones equipped with AI and computer vision to monitor crops and detect disease-affected areas efficiently. By capturing high-quality images of the fields, our system leverages machine learning models to analyze these images and identify early signs of crop disease. With this technology, farmers receive timely insights and recommendations to take preventative or corrective actions, which leads to healthier crops and reduced operational costs.

## Project Value üí∞
Our target customers are farmers and agricultural consultants, particularly those working in rural areas where frequent, manual inspections are costly and labor-intensive. The solution provides substantial benefits, such as early disease detection, actionable insights for disease prevention, and significant reductions in inspection time and costs. By streamlining disease detection, this project enables farmers to apply pesticides to specific regions of the field which are affected. The project also helps target demogrpaphic to make data-driven decisions that can lead to increased crop yield and minimized loss.

## Tech Overview üíª
This project integrates several advanced technologies:
* Drone technology for field inspections
* Computer Vision and AI models for disease detection
* Python for data processing
* TensorFlow for model building and deploying machine learning models
* OpenCV for image processing and analysis
* FastAPI for API development and backend integration

#### Program Overview:
Mr. Tadiwanashe Nyamapfene and Mr. Brighton Chisanga participated in the Rust College AgriTech program, covering agricultural science, sustainable practices, and the integration of technology in agriculture.

#### Drone Training and Certification:
They were trained and certified in drone operations specifically for agricultural applications, they also recieved their FAA liences for unmanned aircraft.

#### Problem Identification:
During the program, they identified key challenges faced by farmers in rural areas like Holly Springs, MS, and other agricultural regions nationwide.

#### Current Challenges:
Farmers incur significant costs inspecting their farms manually to for affected or infected areas.

#### Proposed Solution:
* **Drone Technology**: Utilize drones for field inspections to gather high-resolution images.
* **AI and Computer Vision**: Analyze drone-captured images using AI to detect affected areas and diseases.
* **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on AI analysis to manage and mitigate identified issues.

#### Future Applications:
The team envisions extending this technology to other areas, such as hurricane damage assessment, wildfire monitoring, and pest control.
